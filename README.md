## Motivation
Because i really like Darcula but i don't like the gray background.
I prefer something darker, so i created this V2.

## Limitation

Since VSCode relies on textmate scopes as a selector for theme which sometimes cannot differentiate some syntax like WebStorm. This theme cannot highlight some syntax, for example, global variables in JS, Generic Type in TS.
